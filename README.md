## Features and Functionality

`1.` User Authentication and Authorization:
Implement a firebase user authentication system that allows users to create accounts, log in securely, and manage their profiles. Ensure role-based authorization to distinguish between librarians and regular users, granting appropriate privileges.

`2.` Book Management:
Create a comprehensive book management system that enables librarians to add, edit, and remove books from the library's collection. Include features like ISBN lookup, book details, cover images, and categorization.

`3.` Borrowing and Returning Books:
Develop a system for users to borrow and return books online. Allow users to view their borrowing history, set due dates, and send reminders for overdue books. Ensure that librarians can track borrowed books and manage the borrowing process efficiently.

`4.` JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for Security:
Implement JWT for securing the application. Use JWT to generate and validate tokens for user authentication, ensuring data privacy and security. This adds an additional layer of protection to the website.

`5.` Responsive Design:
Ensure the website is responsive, adapting to various screen sizes and devices (e.g., desktop, tablet, mobile). A responsive design will provide a seamless user experience, making it accessible to a wider audience.
